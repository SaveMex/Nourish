Let the salmon marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. In a medium pan, heat oil. Add salmon to the pan, but discard the used marinade. Cook salmon on one side for about 2-3 minutes, then flip over and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes. Remove salmon from pan. Pour in remaining marinade and reduce. Serve the salmon with sauce and a side of veggies. We used broccoli. Enjoy!",

Transfer pieces to a food processor and rice the cauliflower by pulsing it in the food processor, or by shredding it on a box grater. Once riced, transfer to a large bowl and microwave for 4 minutes. Let it cool down for a few minutes before handling! Transfer cooked cauliflower to a clean towel and wring out as much liquid as possible. Place wrung cauliflower in a bowl and combine with mozzarella, oregano, basil, salt, garlic powder, and an egg. Mix well. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place cauliflower mixture in the middle. Spread out the mixture and form a circle out of the cauliflower mixture, pushing along the edge to raise a “crust.” Bake for 15 minutes, or until the crust has become golden brown in the center and on the edges. Top with your favorite pizza sauce and toppings, being careful not to overload the pizza. Bake for another 5-7 minutes, or until the cheese has fully melted. Enjoy!",
